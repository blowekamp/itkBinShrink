General
------

This is a module for ITK: The Insight Toolkit for Segmentation and
Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4 modular system and
to be places it ITK/Modules/External.


Getting Started
---------------

The official ITKv4 Wiki documentation on adding an external module is here:
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK_Release_4/Modularization/Add_an_external_module_(external_module)

The following is a breif list of instructions to get a external module
started in a repository:

mkdir ITK/Modules/External/itkMyModule
cd ITK/Modules/External/itkMyModule
git init
git fetch git@github.com:blowekamp/itkExternalTemplate.git
git merge FETCH_HEAD

The CMakeLists.txt and itk-modules need to be modified with the name
of the module, something along the following:

sed 's/ExternalTemplate/MyModule/g' CMakeLists.txt itk-module.cmake

There is the inplace option to sed, but it's not portable, so do this
change by hand or look up the option in sed.

Then hack away at you code in include, src, and tests.
